# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The `components/` directory is where you put all your Vue components which can then be imported inside your pages or other components

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components).
