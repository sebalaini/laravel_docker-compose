# STATIC

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The `public/` directory is directly served at the server root and contains public files that have to keep their names
(e.g. `robots.txt`) or likely won't change (e.g. `favicon.ico`).

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public).
