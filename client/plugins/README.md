# PLUGINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

Nuxt automatically reads the files in your plugins directory and loads them at the creation of the Vue application.
You can use `.server` or `.client` suffix in the file name to load a plugin only on the server or client side.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins).
