# ASSETS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The `assets/` directory is used to add all the website's assets that the build tool (webpack or Vite) will process.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/assets).
