## Env

The Laravel `.env` need to reflect the same info inside `docker-compose.yml` and the `packaje.json` (`create:db` and `create:db-user`), update them to match your setup info. You will modify the following fields:

```
DB_HOST The database name container.
DB_DATABASE The laravel database.
DB_USERNAME The username for your database. In this case, we will use laraveluser.
DB_PASSWORD The secure password for this user account. In this case, we will use root.


- api/.env

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laraveluser
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

##  Creating a User for MySQL

The default MySQL installation only creates the root administrative account, which has unlimited privileges on the database server. In general, itâ€™s better to avoid using the root administrative account when interacting with the database.

This step it's done with the `npm run install:db` script that run in the `npm run install` script.

## Install

To install the application run the script `npm run deploy`, this script will install Nuxt and Laravel with the relative dependencies.

## start

With all of your services defined in your docker-compose file, you just need to issue a single command to start all of the containers, create the volumes, and set up and connect the networks:


`$ docker-compose up`

You can now visit `http://127.0.0.1`  or `localhost` in the browser. You will see the home page for your application.

## Migrating Data

The migration is ran with the `artisan migrate` command during the `npm run deploy` step. 

This command will migrate the default Laravel tables. The output confirming the migration will look like this:

```
Output

Migration table created successfully.
Migrating: 2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table
Migrated:  2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table
Migrating: 2014_10_12_100000_create_password_resets_table
Migrated:  2014_10_12_100000_create_password_resets_table
```

## phpMyAdmin

This setup provides a phpMyAdmin interface available at `127.0.0.1:8080` using the same credentials from the `.env` file

## Redis

There is a Redis instance available at `127.0.0.1:63791`, Laravel already has installed `predis/predis`

## External connection with 3rd party software

If you prefer to connect to the database using software like sequel PRO you can connect by using `127.0.0.1` as a host.

## PHP CS Fixer

To run the PHP CS Fixer run the following command: `npm run lint`. The configuration is available in `api/.php-cs-fixer.php`
